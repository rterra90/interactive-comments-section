## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- [ok] Create, Read, Update, and Delete comments and replies
- [ok] Upvote and downvote comments
- [ok] **Bonus**: If you're building a purely front-end project, use `localStorage` to save the current state in the browser that persists when the browser is refreshed.
- **Bonus**: Instead of using the `createdAt` strings from the `data.json` file, try using timestamps and dynamically track the time since the comment or reply was posted.

Expected behaviors

- [ok] First-level comments should be ordered by their score, whereas nested replies are ordered by time added.
- [ok] Replying to a comment adds the new reply to the bottom of the nested replies within that comment.
- [ok] A confirmation modal should pop up before a comment or reply is deleted.
- [ok] Adding a new comment or reply uses the `currentUser` object from within the `data.json` file.
- [ok] You can only edit or delete your own comments and replies.

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it.

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**
